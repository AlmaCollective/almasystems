# Contributing to Alma

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Alma.  
This repository defines the **core architecture** and the conceptual foundation of the system.

---

## How to Contribute

### 1. Documentation First
Before adding or modifying anything:
- read `README.md`
- explore the `/docs`, `/models`, and `/mvp` folders

All changes must align with Alma’s core principle:
> Physiology first, labels later (or not at all).

---

### 2. Branch Naming
Use clear and minimal branch names:
- `docs-update/...`
- `mvp/...`
- `models/...`
- `design/...`

---

### 3. Commit Messages
Short, precise, and meaningful:
- `Add MVP overview`
- `Update destabilization model`
- `Improve architecture diagram`

Avoid vague descriptions like “fix stuff”.

---

### 4. Structure
Please keep files in their correct folders:
- MVP → `/mvp`
- models → `/models`
- architecture → `/design`
- general docs → `/docs`
