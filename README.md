# Alma Systems – Real-Time Emotional Regulation

Alma is a real-time emotional regulation system that listens to the body **before the mind breaks**.

We capture micro-patterns of the nervous system – breath shifts, tension rhythms, HRV changes – and translate them into **early, actionable clarity**, so people can self-regulate before emotional overload appears.

## 🌱 Core Insight

> The nervous system speaks long before behavior does.  
> Alma gives people **early clarity** – the exact moment where life can be improved, pressure can be handled, and decisions can stay human.

## 💡 What Alma Does

- Detects early physiological signals of overload (pre-stress window)  
- Surfaces a clear **“regulate now”** moment the user can act on in seconds  
- Provides a foundation for multiple layers of use: individuals, teams, institutions, and venture

Alma does **not** try to guess or label emotions.  
It identifies the *tipping point* where clarity starts to collapse.

## 🧩 Product Layers

Alma has three primary layers and one secondary, all built on the same physiological core.

See [`docs/alma_layers.md`](docs/alma_layers.md) for details.

- **B2C – Individuals**  
  Real-time emotional self-regulation in daily life.

- **B2B – Teams & Institutions**  
  Emotional safety and performance insights for high-pressure environments.

- **B2V – Venture / Founder Insights**  
  Identifying founders with real nervous-system resilience (outlier adaptability patterns).

- **B2G – Public Systems (Secondary / Later Layer)**  
  Early overload detection and emotional safety for education and public services.

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

- **Signal Layer** – heart rhythm / HRV, breath patterns, micro-tension signals  
- **Interpretation Layer** – adaptive models learning each user’s personal rhythm  
- **Clarity Layer** – simple, timely cues (“regulate now”), not complex dashboards  
- **Application Layer** – B2C, B2B, B2V, B2G

More details live under [`/docs`](docs/).

## 📌 Current Status

- Stage: **Ideation / Early Architecture**  
- Focus: physiological core + product layers  
- Next steps:
  - refine data model for micro-patterns  
  - define MVP for B2C  
  - map extension paths to B2B and B2V
