# Alma – FAQ

This document answers common questions about Alma’s purpose, vision, and technical approach.

---

## ❓ What is Alma?

Alma is a real-time emotional regulation system that detects early nervous-system destabilization and sends a simple clarity cue before overload becomes visible.

It listens to physiology, not to thoughts.

---

## ❓ Is Alma an emotion classifier?

**No.**  
Alma does not label emotions.  
It does not guess what you feel.

It identifies:
- baseline
- destabilization
- recovery

It delivers timing, not interpretation.

---

## ❓ What kind of signals does Alma use?

Early versions use:
- breath rhythm
- HRV micro-patterns
- tension indicators (if available)

Future versions may integrate additional biosignals, but the core remains low-frequency and non-invasive.

---

## ❓ How does Alma detect overload?

Alma learns:
- your baseline  
- your early destabilization signature  
- your recovery signature  

When destabilization rises quickly, Alma issues a **“regulate now”** cue.

---

## ❓ Why not just use mindfulness or breathwork?

Because people act too late.

Mindfulness works **after** awareness exists.  
Alma works **before** awareness appears.

It closes the timing gap.

---

## ❓ Is Alma a mental health tool?

No.  
Alma does not diagnose, treat, or replace clinical care.

It is a **clarity tool**, not a therapy tool.

Think of it as:
> a mirror of your nervous system, not your mind.

---

## ❓ How does Alma preserve privacy?

- no emotional labels  
- no personality inference  
- no long-term storage required for MVP  
- aggregated and anonymized insights for B2B  
- individual data stays on device as much as possible

Alma is built around minimal, responsible data principles.

---

## ❓ Why will Alma work for B2B?

Because teams in high-pressure environments break for the same reason individuals do:
they fail to notice **early destabilization**.

Alma helps:
- reduce critical mistakes  
- prevent burnout  
- design healthier rhythms

---

## ❓ How does Alma help venture (B2V)?

By revealing:
- recovery speed  
- adaptability under stress  
- clarity stability  
- physiological resilience signatures

These patterns strongly correlate with long-term founder sustainability.

---

## ❓ Why B2G later?

Because public systems (especially education) carry emotional load at scale.  
Alma can offer early safety signals — but only after the core technology is mature.

---

## ❓ What does Alma need right now?

1. MVP validation  
2. First data patterns  
3. A simple prototype cue system  
4. Technical collaborators for the Signal + Interpretation layers  
5. Early ecosystem partners (accelerators, institutions)

---

## ❓ What is Alma’s long-term ambition?

To become the **clarity layer** of human life —  
a gentle signal that helps people, teams and systems stay human under pressure.
