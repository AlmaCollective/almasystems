# Alma – Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the evolution of Alma from concept to deployable product layers.

---

# 0. Foundation (Completed)
- Core architecture defined  
- Pattern models documented  
- MVP logic designed  
- Alma layers (B2C, B2B, B2V, B2G) clarified  
- High-level diagrams created  

---

# 1. MVP (Current Stage)

## Goal:
Deliver early destabilization detection + clarity cue in real time.

## Tasks:
- implement breath-based signal capture (basic prototype)
- integrate simple destabilization threshold logic
- build minimal clarity cue system (pulse / notification)
- record 30–60s rolling window of data
- prepare a small test set for early user trials

Outcome:
A working demo that proves Alma’s thesis.

---

# 2. Core System (After MVP)

## Signal Layer:
- add HRV detection  
- add tension sensors (if available)
- noise reduction pipeline  

## Interpretation Layer:
- adaptive baselines  
- adaptive thresholds  
- improved destabilization detection  
- recovery signature mapping  

Outcome:
A stable internal engine.

# 3. B2C v1 – Individuals

Features:
- personalized baseline learning  
- real-time clarity cues  
- daily micro-pattern insights (very minimal)  
- no emotional labels  

Outcome:
First real product.

---

# 4. B2B – Teams & Institutions

- aggregated pattern views  
- overload window prediction  
- recovery support for high-pressure teams  
- early warning dashboards (non-emotional, non-invasive)

Outcome:
Institutional clarity tools.

---

# 5. B2V – Venture (Founder Resilience)

- resilience profiles  
- stress–recovery mapping  
- clarity stability scoring  
- optional venture dashboards

Outcome:
Physiological resilience insights for venture decision-making.

---

# 6. B2G – Public Systems (Later Layer)

- education emotional-safety mapping  
- pattern shifts in classrooms  
- early overload detection for children  
- public health insights based on nervous-system patterns  

Outcome:
Long-term societal clarity.

# Summary

Alma grows in 4 phases:

1. **MVP** – prove early clarity  
2. **Core Engine** – make it reliable  
3. **B2C** – bring it to people  
4. **B2B / B2V / B2G** – scale clarity to teams, venture and public systems

The entire path stays rooted in one thesis:

> When the nervous system gets clarity early, humans stay human.
