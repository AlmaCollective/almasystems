# Alma Foundations  
*The Deep Structure Behind a System That Understands the Human Nervous System*

Alma is not built for one industry, one vertical, or one use case.  
It is built around a single fundamental principle:

**The nervous system tells the truth before the mind can interpret it.**

This document describes the core foundations that make Alma versatile,  
hard to categorise, and valuable across multiple domains.

## 1. Alma’s Core Insight  
Every emotional state begins as a pattern of micro-signals: breath changes, HRV shifts, tension waves, instability loops, micro-dissonance between intention and action.

The mind perceives these signals *later*.  
Alma aims to detect them *first*.

Alma does not interpret emotions.  
It detects **destabilisation of the nervous system** before it spirals into behaviour.

## 2. Why Alma Does Not Fit in Traditional Categories  
Most products in this space are:

- **Wellness tools:** focused on relaxation or journaling  
- **Medical devices:** regulated, disease-oriented  
- **Wearables:** passive tracking  
- **Mental health apps:** reflective, after-the-fact  

Alma is **none** of these.  
Alma sits one layer below:

**A real-time clarity layer that operates before emotion becomes behaviour.**

This makes Alma inherently cross-domain:

- personal regulation  
- team cohesion  
- founder resilience  
- crisis prevention  
- system-level emotional stability  
- human-AI interaction  
- organisational health  
- public system coordination  

Alma is not a device.  
Alma is an *operating principle*.

## 3. Alma’s Structure (The Four Layers)

### 1. **Sensing Layer**  
Basic micro-signals (breath, tension, rhythm variability, recovery waves).

### 2. **Interpretation Layer**  
Alma maps these into **“stability vs destabilisation”**, not moods or labels.

### 3. **Clarity Layer**  
A simple cue delivered in real-time:
“regulate now”

No emotion naming.  
No cognitive load.  
Just clarity.

### 4. **Application Layer**  
Different faces of the same system:

- B2C: emotional clarity for individuals  
- B2B: teams, leadership, decision-making  
- B2V: founder resilience  
- B2G: systemic clarity & early detection of collective overload  

---

## 4. Why Alma Is Versatile  
Alma is built on universal physiology, not a specific industry.  
Therefore, anywhere humans lose clarity — Alma fits.

It is not expanding into many markets.  
It is returning to the *same truth* applied in different contexts:
**Humans lose clarity before they lose control.**

If you can detect this moment, you can intervene early —  
in a family, a boardroom, a startup, a team, or a nation.

---

## 5. Alma’s Purpose  
To give the human nervous system a voice,  
so people can return to themselves *before* the mind breaks under overload.

It is not therapy.  
It is not diagnosis.  
It is a companion system for the most fragile moment inside us:

**the moment before we lose ourselves.**

---

## 6. What Alma Is (and Is Not)

**Alma is:**
- a clarity engine  
- a nervous-system early warning system  
- a stabilisation interface  
- a real-time feedback loop  

**Alma is not:**
- a medical device  
- a wellness gadget  
- an emotion classifier  
- a biometric toy  

---

## 7. Why Now?  
Modern life overloads the nervous system faster than the mind can compensate.

Alma exists because people are collapsing under invisible loads —  
and no system is designed to detect the moment *before* the collapse.

Alma fills that gap, quietly and precisely.

## Temporal Cadence & the "Déjà-Vu Window"

Alma is built on a simple but important assumption:

> Emotions don’t just have *intensity* – they also have a **temporal cadence**.  
> When the “felt” stream and the “story” stream fall out of sync, humans experience confusion, overload, or even déjà-vu.

### Two parallel streams

Alma models emotional experience as two coupled streams:

1. **Somatic / fast stream**  
   - High-frequency biosignals (HR, HRV, EDA, respiration, etc.).  
   - Arrive in the nervous system and in Alma as a continuous, fast-updating flow.  
   - This stream “knows” something is happening before we can name it.

2. **Cognitive / slow stream**  
   - The narrative layer: thoughts, labels, explanations, internal dialogue.  
   - Arrives slightly later, because the brain needs time to interpret and compress what the body already felt.

Under normal conditions, these two streams stay **phase-locked**: what I feel in my body and what I tell myself about it arrive almost together, so the experience feels coherent.

### The Déjà-Vu Window (50–300 ms)

When the cognitive stream is delayed by a small but noticeable offset (≈ 50–300 ms), the brain can misinterpret the situation as:

> “Wait… this already happened.”

It hasn’t. What actually happened is:

- the **somatic stream** registered the event first,
- the **cognitive stream** arrived slightly later,
- and the brain compared “now” with a snapshot from a few hundred milliseconds ago.

Alma uses this idea as a **design constraint**:

- We keep Alma’s micro-cadence for internal updates **below 200 ms**,  
  so the system can *track* these micro-mismatches instead of averaging them away.

### How Alma uses cadence

Alma maintains rolling buffers of both streams:

- a **somatic buffer** of raw and derived biosignal features,
- a **cognitive proxy buffer** (self-reports, interaction patterns, language, app usage, etc.).

For each window, Alma estimates a **coherence lag**:

\[
\text{coherence_lag} = t_{\text{cognitive peak}} - t_{\text{somatic peak}}
\]

Then it can:

- detect when the lag stays **small and stable** → *high temporal coherence* (body & story aligned);  
- detect when the lag drifts or oscillates in the **50–300 ms band** → *déjà-vu / emotional echo zone*;  
- detect when the lag explodes into seconds or minutes → *rumination, dissociation, or overload*.

Alma doesn’t label these states as “pathology”.  
Instead, it treats them as **patterns of timing** that can be trained and gently re-aligned.

### Why this matters for resilience

Most tools only look at *what* you feel (“stressed / not stressed”).  
Alma also looks at **when** your body and your inner story fall out of sync.

This enables:

- early warning for **emotional spirals** (before behaviour explodes),  
- personalized exercises that nudge the system back into **coherent cadence**,  
- a new class of metrics: *temporal coherence*, *emotional echo*, *resonant window*, etc.

In short:

> Alma doesn’t try to delete déjà-vu.  
> It learns from the tiny timing errors that make it possible –  
> and uses them as a compass to bring you back into yourself before overload hits.
