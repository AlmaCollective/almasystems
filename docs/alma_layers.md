# Alma Product Layers – B2C, B2B, B2V, B2G

Alma is a **physiological clarity layer** that can operate across individual, organizational, and societal contexts.

All layers share the same core function:

> Early detection of nervous-system destabilization →  
> a clear, timely signal for self-regulation.

---

## 1. B2C – Individuals (Self-Regulation)

**Who:** parents, children, sensitive nervous systems, people dealing with chronic overload, anxiety, or high-pressure daily life.

**What Alma does:**

- reads micro-changes in breath, HRV, tension patterns  
- detects the moment *before* overload becomes conscious  
- provides a simple cue: **“regulate now”**  
- supports micro-rituals (breathing, grounding, light movement)

**Outcome:** fewer emotional collapses; more **everyday clarity** and regulation.

---

## 2. B2B – Teams & Institutions

**Who:** education, healthcare, emergency staff, customer support teams, frontline roles.

**What Alma does:**

- tracks aggregated overload patterns (no emotion labels)  
- highlights **rising stress windows** in teams  
- supports early intervention before mistakes, burnout, or breakdown  
- helps design healthier schedules, break patterns, workflows

**Outcome:** fewer errors, less burnout, more **stable performance**.

## 3. B2V – Venture / Founder Resilience

**Who:** venture programs, accelerators, VC funds, startup scouts.

**What Alma does:**

- measures **adaptability** and **recovery speed** under pressure  
- identifies nervous-system patterns typical of resilient founders  
- adds an objective dimension to founder evaluation  
- gives founders feedback for long-term emotional sustainability

**Outcome:** better selection of founders who can handle real long-term pressure, not only pitch well.

## 4. B2G – Public Systems (Future Layer)

**Who:** education systems, public health, social services, public safety.

**What Alma can support:**

- early detection of emotional overload in classrooms or institutions  
- real-time clarity for teachers, counselors, caregivers  
- community-wide stress pattern insights  
- preventive emotional-safety strategies

**Outcome:** emotionally safer public systems focused on **prevention**, not reaction.

## Summary

- **B2C** — individuals  
- **B2B** — teams & institutions  
- **B2V** — venture & founder resilience  
- **B2G** — public systems  

> Physiology first, cognition second.  
> When we listen to the body early, everything else improves.
