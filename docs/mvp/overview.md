# Alma MVP – Overview

The first version of Alma focuses on **one single outcome**:

> Detect the early destabilization moment in the nervous system and deliver a clear “regulate now” cue.

This MVP is intentionally simple, minimal and realistic.

---

## 🎯 MVP Goal

Create a system that can:
1. capture at least one physiological micro-signal,
2. detect a destabilization pattern,
3. trigger a clarity cue within 1–5 seconds,
4. without visual dashboards or emotional labels.

The MVP is not about full functionality.  
It is about proving that *early clarity* can be delivered in real time.

## 🧩 What the MVP Includes

### **1. Signal Intake**
(choose one to start)
- breath rhythm variance  
- HRV micro-shifts  
- simple tension indicator (binary)  

We begin with **breath**, because it’s easiest to capture and highly correlated with overload.

---

### **2. Pattern Logic (Simplified)**
The MVP uses a very basic pattern model:

- baseline breath rhythm  
- micro-deviations  
- destabilization peak  
- recovery attempt  

If destabilization > threshold → trigger cue.

Threshold is adaptive, not fixed.

---

### **3. Clarity Cue**
Output = **one simple signal**:

- vibration pulse  
- short sound  
- on-screen prompt  

The cue is **time-sensitive**, not descriptive.

---

### **4. Recording Window**
MVP stores 30–60 seconds of data in memory.  
No long-term tracking.

## Example Flow (User Journey)

1. User wears/watches the device.  
2. Alma captures breath rhythm.  
3. Nervous system destabilizes slightly → Alma detects micro-pattern.  
4. Within 3 seconds → user receives cue: **“regulate now.”**  
5. User breathes once or twice → recovery.  
6. Alma confirms clarity is restored.

---

## Why This MVP Works

It proves the **core thesis**:

> A subtle physiological shift predicts emotional overload.  
> If we act early, clarity returns before collapse happens.

Once this works, everything else (B2C → B2B → B2V → B2G) becomes a layer on top.

---

## Next Steps After MVP

- add more signal types  
- refine adaptive thresholds  
- test in real-life scenarios  
- integrate micro-rituals (breath / somatic cues)  
- begin mapping team-level patterns (B2B)
