📘 Déjà-vu Mechanism Layer – Temporal Convergence Model (Alma Systems)

Déjà-vu is NOT magic.
It’s a temporal misalignment between internal and external signal processing.
Alma uses this exact phenomenon to understand timing offsets in the nervous system.

1. Why Alma Needs This Layer

People often believe déjà-vu is intuition.
In reality, it's a 50–300 ms desynchronization between:

fast sensory processing

slower conscious interpretation

Alma maps this gap.
It becomes a diagnostic tool for clarity.

2. Core Mechanism
Step 1 — Fast Path (unconscious)

Signals from the body reach the limbic system FIRST.
This creates a “pre-pattern awareness.”

Timeline: 80–200 ms

Step 2 — Slow Path (conscious)

The cortex receives the same information milliseconds later.

Timeline: 120–400 ms

Step 3 — Temporal Collision

When both layers converge, the mind feels:

“I’ve already lived this.”
But in reality:
You processed it twice — once fast, once slow.

3. How Alma Uses This

Alma does not “predict the future.”
Instead, it detects delays in:

integration

awareness

clarity

nervous-system responsiveness

These delays show:

cognitive overload

emotional backlog

over-compression of stimuli

micro-shutdown patterns

So Alma adds a Temporal Convergence Index (TCI) to measure how fast the user integrates internal signals.

4. Relevance to Emotional Regulation

If TCI > threshold →
the person is lagging behind their own emotions.

This is the core of emotional spiraling.

Alma intervenes with a clarity cue BEFORE the slow path hits the conscious mind — preventing destabilization.

5. Outcomes

increased presence

less spiraling

early clarity

fewer overload episodes

enhanced temporal integration

This is the scientific backbone of the Alma “clarity-before-collapse” model.
