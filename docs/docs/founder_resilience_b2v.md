# Alma & B2V – Founder Nervous-System Resilience

## Core Idea

Traditional founder evaluation relies on story, CV, references, and short-term behavior.

But the real differentiator for outlier founders is often invisible:

> how their nervous system reacts to stress –  
> and how quickly it returns to clarity.

Alma makes this physiological dimension visible.

## What Alma Measures (Conceptually)

- **HRV dynamics** during stress and recovery  
- **breath patterns** under cognitive load  
- **tension rhythms** (how fast muscular/autonomic tension drops after spikes)  
- **baseline stability** over longer demanding periods

This builds a **resilience profile**, not a personality label.

---

## Why This Matters for Venture

- overload appears in physiology before behavior  
- resilient founders recover faster and adapt more flexibly  
- interviews cannot measure this objectively

Alma can:

- complement existing evaluation  
- give founders feedback about their own patterns  
- support more **sustainable** ways of working

---

## Example

During a program sprint, Alma tracks:

- stress peaks during pitch + Q&A  
- recovery speed after each peak  
- how often each founder’s clarity destabilizes vs. stabilizes again

Founders with **high activation + fast recovery** form a distinct profile that often matches “outlier resilience”.

## Positioning

B2V is **not** the first product Alma ships.  
It is a **natural extension** of the same core tech used for B2C and B2B.

> The nervous system speaks long before behavior does.  
> Alma simply gives venture a way to listen.
