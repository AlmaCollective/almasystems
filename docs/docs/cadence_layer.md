📘 Cadence Layer – System Overview (for Alma Systems)

The Cadence Layer is Alma’s temporal backbone.
It defines when Alma listens, how often it evaluates signals, and how quickly it reacts.

Cadence = the micro-timing of perception → interpretation → cue delivery.

1. Purpose

Humans often lose emotional clarity because internal signals arrive at the mind too fast or too slow to be consciously integrated.
The Cadence Layer stabilizes this by giving Alma a predictable temporal rhythm.

It ensures that:

micro-signals are captured before they collapse into emotional noise

interpretation happens consistently

cues are delivered early enough to change behavior

2. Why Cadence Matters

The nervous system operates on sub-second timelines:

respiratory shifts: ~80–200 ms

micro-arousal spikes: ~150–300 ms

HRV windowing: 30–60 seconds

vagal shifts: 300–800 ms

If Alma samples too slowly → it misses destabilization.
If Alma samples too quickly → it creates false positives.

Cadence = balance.

3. Cadence Structure

Alma uses 3 intertwined time-scales:

A. Micro-cadence (100–200 ms)

Purpose: detect micro-instability before conscious awareness.
Inputs:

breath acceleration

shallow-breath onset

micro-tremors

sudden HR tightening

This layer is what generates the “déjà-vu delay effect” when the mind receives processed signals milliseconds after Alma detects them.

B. Meso-cadence (6–12 seconds)

Purpose: confirm patterns, avoid false positives.
Processes:

rolling windows for interpretation

micro-arousal confirmation

signal smoothing

early trend detection

This is Alma’s “sanity check.”

C. Macro-cadence (30–90 seconds)

Purpose: detect emotional spirals before they start.
Processes:

destabilization slope tracking

vagal collapse trends

recovery delay tracking

4. How the Cadence Layer interacts with Interpretation Layer

Cadence provides:

time-aligned windows

threshold stability

noise gating

context continuity

Interpretation Layer then converts these temporal patterns into meaning.

5. Outcomes

The Cadence Layer makes Alma capable of:

detecting the moment BEFORE overload

predicting emotional collapse

providing clarity in time for behavioral correction

creating high-resolution emotional timing

Humans feel it as: “I understood myself earlier than usual.”
