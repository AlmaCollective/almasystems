📘 Cadence Layer – System Overview (for Alma Systems)

The Cadence Layer is Alma’s temporal backbone.
It defines when Alma listens, how often it evaluates signals, and how quickly it reacts.

Cadence = the micro-timing of perception → interpretation → cue delivery.

1. Purpose

Humans often lose emotional clarity because internal signals arrive at the mind too fast or too slow to be consciously integrated.
The Cadence Layer stabilizes this by giving Alma a predictable temporal rhythm.

It ensures that:

micro-signals are captured before they collapse into emotional noise

interpretation happens consistently

cues are delivered early enough to change behavior

2. Why Cadence Matters

The nervous system operates on sub-second timelines:

respiratory shifts: ~80–200 ms

micro-arousal spikes: ~150–300 ms

HRV windowing: 30–60 seconds

vagal shifts: 300–800 ms

If Alma samples too slowly → it misses destabilization.
If Alma samples too quickly → it creates false positives.

Cadence = balance.

3. Cadence Structure

Alma uses 3 intertwined time-scales:

A. Micro-cadence (100–200 ms)

Purpose: detect micro-instability before conscious awareness.
Inputs:

breath acceleration

shallow-breath onset

micro-tremors

sudden HR tightening

This layer is what generates the “déjà-vu delay effect” when the mind receives processed signals milliseconds after Alma detects them.

B. Meso-cadence (6–12 seconds)

Purpose: confirm patterns, avoid false positives.
Processes:

rolling windows for interpretation

micro-arousal confirmation

signal smoothing

early trend detection

This is Alma’s “sanity check.”

C. Macro-cadence (30–90 seconds)

Purpose: detect emotional spirals before they start.
Processes:

destabilization slope tracking

vagal collapse trends

recovery delay tracking

4. How the Cadence Layer interacts with Interpretation Layer

Cadence provides:

time-aligned windows

threshold stability

noise gating

context continuity

Interpretation Layer then converts these temporal patterns into meaning.

5. Outcomes

The Cadence Layer makes Alma capable of:

detecting the moment BEFORE overload

predicting emotional collapse

providing clarity in time for behavioral correction

creating high-resolution emotional timing

Humans feel it as: “I understood myself earlier than usual.”

The micro-timing engine of Alma

The Cadence Layer is the foundational timing architecture that allows Alma to sense, predict, and stabilize human nervous-system shifts before they reach conscious awareness.

It focuses on sub-perceptual micro-windows of time — the intervals in which the body reacts before the mind interprets.

1. Purpose

The Cadence Layer provides:

Temporal coherence: aligning sensor signals into unified micro-windows

Predictive sensitivity: detecting small timing delays or accelerations that indicate destabilization

Synchronization: keeping all layers of Alma “in rhythm”

Cadence is the “heartbeat of the system.” Without it, interpretation becomes noise.

2. The Core Rule: <200 ms Windows

Human nervous-system responsiveness operates strongly within the 50–200 ms intervals:

Breath micro-adjustments

HRV spikes

Muscle tension shifts

Micro-hesitations

Attention flicker

If cadence slips, the user experiences misalignment, perceived as:

overwhelm

confusion

micro-freeze

emotional spiraling

déjà-vu states (explained in the next layer)

Alma continuously samples and aligns signals in these micro-windows.

3. What Cadence Detects

Cadence deviations = early destabilization markers.

Examples:

Delayed breath return (e.g., exhale lag by +90 ms)

Heart rhythm desynchronization from breath

Micro-pauses in cognitive flow

Tiny timing mismatches between intention → action

These events appear before emotion is fully formed.

4. Output of the Cadence Layer

The layer outputs a stability score plus a timing deviation map:
cadence_stability: 0.82
micro_delay_cluster: [124ms, 137ms, 142ms]
breath_alignment: 0.91
rhythm_integrity: stable
This output is passed to:

Deja-Vu Layer (pattern-level explanation)

Interpretation Layer (emotional clarity logic)
