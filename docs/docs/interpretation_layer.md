Interpretation Layer — How Alma Translates Micro-Signals into Meaning

The Interpretation Layer is the core of Alma’s intelligence:
it transforms raw physiological micro-signals into a coherent, time-sensitive understanding of the user's internal state.

This layer does not guess “emotions.”
It detects patterns of destabilization, shifts in clarity, and changes in nervous-system stability before they escalate into visible behaviour.

1. Purpose of the Interpretation Layer

To convert continuous physiological input into:

Baseline signatures

Deviation patterns

Micro-instability markers

Direction of change (toward overload or toward recovery)

Intensity trajectory (growing, stable, or dissipating)

This layer provides the first true “intelligence” of Alma:
it understands what the signals mean, not just what they are.

2. Core Functions
2.1 Baseline Calibration

Alma learns each user’s stable patterns during moments of:

calm clarity

coherent breathing

steady HRV

low neuromuscular noise

The baseline is not static — it updates gradually based on new stable periods.

2.2 Deviation Detection (Sub-200ms)

Alma continuously monitors micro-shifts in:

breathing cadence

interoceptive rhythm

heart rhythm variability

micro-tension

recovery slope after distraction

When deviation exceeds a personalized threshold, Alma marks a destabilization moment.

This happens in <200ms, before the conscious mind detects anything.

2.3 Pattern Recognition

The layer identifies:

rising instability spirals

sudden drops in clarity

neural “static” bursts

pre-overload loops

convergence patterns (when multiple signals align → high significance)

These patterns form Alma’s “internal language.”

2.4 Direction Mapping

Alma assesses whether the user is moving toward:

clarity

overload

fragmentation

stabilization

tension accumulation

impulsive action

It’s a vector, not a label:
WHERE the system is going, not WHAT emotion it is.

2.5 Significance Scoring

Each deviation receives a composite score based on:

amplitude

duration

multi-signal correlation

recovery potential

user’s historical patterns

This score determines whether Alma should trigger a Clarity Cue.

3. Why This Matters

Most systems react after the emotion becomes behaviour.
Alma reacts:

before the mind spirals

before clarity collapses

before behaviour shifts

before burnout patterns lock in

This is the structural advantage of Alma:
Reaction → Prediction → Pre-emption.
Not emotional labeling.
Not advice.
Just clarity.

4. Interpretation Layer Output

The output is a structured signal:
{
  "instability_score": 0.72,
  "direction": "rising",
  "window": "90ms",
  "confidence": 0.86,
  "pattern": "micro-spiral onset",
  "needs_cue": true
}
This output feeds directly into the Clarity Cue Layer, initiating real-time regulation.

5. Relationship to the Cadence Layer & déjà-vu Layer

Cadence Layer detects timing shifts and micro-delays in interoceptive rhythm.

Déjà-vu Layer explains temporal desynchronization between perception and cognition.

Interpretation Layer integrates both and maps the significance of those shifts.

Together, they form Alma’s early-warning intelligence.

6. Future Extensions

This layer can later incorporate:

multi-modal sensor fusion

ultra-short HRV windows

predictive models (non-ML first, ML optional)

personalized “clarity maps”

team-level pattern correlation

founder-specific instability signatures
