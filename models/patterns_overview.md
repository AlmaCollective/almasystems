# Alma – Pattern Models Overview

Alma is built on the idea that the nervous system reveals emotional overload **before** the mind becomes aware of it.  
We call these early physiological signatures: **patterns**.

Patterns are not emotions.  
They are **micro-changes in physiology** that predict emotional state shifts.

Below is an overview of the first models used to detect destabilization and recovery.

---

# 1. Baseline Pattern

Baseline is the user's stable physiological rhythm when emotional clarity is intact.

Baseline includes:
- breath rhythm stability
- HRV in the user’s normal range
- minimal tension spikes
- smooth recovery from small disturbances

Alma continuously updates baseline through adaptive learning.

# 2. Destabilization Pattern

This is the central pattern Alma detects.

Destabilization is defined as:
- a rapid micro-drop in HRV, OR
- a sudden irregularity in breath rhythm, OR
- a rise in micro-tension sustained for >500 ms

Destabilization does not mean “emotion”.  
It means:
> “The nervous system is about to lose clarity.”

The MVP triggers the clarity cue when destabilization > threshold.

# 3. Overload Curve (Early)

This model describes how a destabilization grows when no regulation occurs.

Early overload curve typically shows:
- increasing tension rhythm  
- reduced breath variability  
- narrowed HRV window  
- delayed recovery response  

In the MVP, this curve is **not shown to the user**.  
It is only used internally to detect when a cue is needed.

---

# 4. Recovery Signature

After a clarity cue, Alma looks for the recovery pattern.

Recovery signature includes:
- breath pattern smoothing
- HRV returning toward baseline
- tension releasing within a short window

The recovery signature is one of the most important markers of resilience:
> How fast does the nervous system return to clarity?

This is the foundation of the B2V (venture founder resilience) layer.

---

# 5. Adaptive Threshold

Alma cannot use a fixed threshold because everyone has a unique nervous system.

The adaptive threshold:
- tracks fluctuations over time
- adjusts to daily variability
- differentiates healthy activation vs overload
- prevents false positives

Example:
A person in physical activity may show destabilization-like signals.  
Adaptive threshold prevents unnecessary cues.

---

# 6. Spiral Window (Future Model)

This model represents the “shape” of destabilization and recovery over time.

A spiral window captures:
- the amplitude of destabilization  
- the slope of recovery  
- how patterns widen or narrow over days  

Spiral models allow Alma to understand:
> not just how the user feels today,  
> but how their system is evolving long-term.

(This is a future model, documented here for design clarity.)

# Summary

Alma does not classify emotions.  
It detects and understands **patterns**, which are early physiological movements predicting emotional clarity or overload.

Core models:
- Baseline Pattern  
- Destabilization Pattern  
- Overload Curve  
- Recovery Signature  
- Adaptive Threshold  
- Spiral Window (future)

These models power the clarity layer:
> If destabilization rises → cue early.  
> If recovery begins → confirm clarity.

Alma’s intelligence is rooted in the body, not in labels.
